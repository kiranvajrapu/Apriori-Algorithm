    "Association rule mining is a technique to identify underlying relations between different items. Take an example of a Super Market where customers can buy variety of items. Usually, there is a pattern in what the customers buy. For instance, mothers with babies buy baby products such as milk and diapers. Damsels may buy makeup items whereas bachelors may buy beers and chips etc. In short, transactions involve a pattern. More profit can be generated if the relationship between the items purchased in different transactions can be identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if item A and B are bought together more frequently then several steps can be taken to increase the profit. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "A and B can be placed together so that when a customer buys one of the product he doesn't have to go far away to buy the other product.\n",
    "People who buy one of the products can be targeted through an advertisement campaign to buy the other.\n",
    "Collective discounts can be offered on these products if the customer buys both of them.\n",
    "Both A and B can be packaged together.\n",
    "The process of identifying an associations between products is called association rule mining."

    "Apriori Algorithm for Association Rule Mining\n",
    "Different statistical algorithms have been developed to implement association rule mining, and Apriori is one such algorithm. In this article we will study the theory behind the Apriori algorithm and will later implement Apriori algorithm in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Theory of Apriori Algorithm\n",
    "There are three major components of Apriori algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "Support\n",
    "Confidence\n",
    "Lift\n",
    "We will explain these three concepts with the help of an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a record of 1 thousand customer transactions, and we want to find the Support, Confidence, and Lift for two items e.g. burgers and ketchup. Out of one thousand transactions, 100 contain ketchup while 150 contain a burger. Out of 150 transactions where a burger is purchased, 50 transactions contain ketchup as well. Using this data, we want to find the support, confidence, and lift.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support\n",
    "Support refers to the default popularity of an item and can be calculated by finding number of transactions containing a particular item divided by total number of transactions. Suppose we want to find support for item B. This can be calculated as:"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "#### Support(B) = (Transactions containing (B))/(Total Transactions)  \n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "For instance if out of 1000 transactions, 100 transactions contain Ketchup then the support for item Ketchup can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Support(Ketchup) = (Transactions containingKetchup)/(Total Transactions)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Support(Ketchup) = 100/1000  = 10%\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confidence\n",
    "Confidence refers to the likelihood that an item B is also bought if item A is bought. It can be calculated by finding the number of transactions where A and B are bought together, divided by total number of transactions where A is bought. Mathematically, it can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confidence(A→B) = (Transactions containing both (A and B))/(Transactions containing A)  \n",
    "Coming back to our problem, we had 50 transactions where Burger and Ketchup were bought together. While in 150 transactions, burgers are bought. Then we can find likelihood of buying ketchup when a burger is bought can be represented as confidence of Burger -> Ketchup and can be mathematically written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confidence(Burger→Ketchup) = (Transactions containing both (Burger and Ketchup))/(Transactions containing A)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confidence(Burger→Ketchup) = 50/150  = 33.3%\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "You may notice that this is similar to what you'd see in the Naive Bayes Algorithm, however, the two algorithms are meant for different types of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lift\n",
    "Lift(A -> B) refers to the increase in the ratio of sale of B when A is sold. Lift(A –> B) can be calculated by dividing Confidence(A -> B) divided by Support(B). Mathematically it can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lift(A→B) = (Confidence (A→B))/(Support (B))  \n",
    "\n",
    "Coming back to our Burger and Ketchup problem, the Lift(Burger -> Ketchup) can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lift(Burger→Ketchup) = (Confidence (Burger→Ketchup))/(Support (Ketchup))\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lift(Burger→Ketchup) = 33.3/10  = 3.33\n",
    "Lift basically tells us that the likelihood of buying a Burger and Ketchup together is 3.33 times more than the likelihood of just buying the ketchup. A Lift of 1 means there is no association between products A and B. Lift of greater than 1 means products A and B are more likely to be bought together. Finally, Lift of less than 1 refers to the case where two products are unlikely to be bought together.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps Involved in Apriori Algorithm\n",
    "For large sets of data, there can be hundreds of items in hundreds of thousands transactions. The Apriori algorithm tries to extract rules for each possible combination of items. For instance, Lift can be calculated for item 1 and item 2, item 1 and item 3, item 1 and item 4 and then item 2 and item 3, item 2 and item 4 and then combinations of items e.g. item 1, item 2 and item 3; similarly item 1, item2, and item 4, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from the above example, this process can be extremely slow due to the number of combinations. To speed up the process, we need to perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Set a minimum value for support and confidence. This means that we are only interested in finding rules for the items that have certain default existence (e.g. support) and have a minimum value for co-occurrence with other items (e.g. confidence).\n",
    "Extract all the subsets having higher value of support than minimum threshold.\n",
    "Select all the rules from the subsets with confidence value higher than minimum threshold.\n",
    "Order the rules by descending order of Lift.\n",
    "Implementing Apriori Algorithm with Python\n",
    "Enough of theory, now is the time to see the Apriori algorithm in action. In this section we will use the Apriori algorithm to find rules that describe associations between different products given 7500 transactions over the course of a week at a French retail store. The dataset can be downloaded from the following link:"

Next, the min_confidence parameter filters those rules that have confidence greater than the confidence threshold specified by the parameter. Similarly, the min_lift parameter specifies the minimum lift value for the short listed rules. Finally, the min_length parameter specifies the minimum number of items that you want in your rules.\n",

The support for those items can be calculated as 35/7500 = 0.0045. The minimum confidence for the rules is 20% or 0.2. Similarly, we specify the value for lift as 3 and finally min_length is 2 since we want at least two products in our rules. These values are mostly just arbitrarily chosen, so you can play with these values and see what difference it makes in the rules you get back out.\n",

    "We have already discussed the first rule. Let's now discuss the second rule. The second rule states that mushroom cream sauce and escalope are bought frequently. The support for mushroom cream sauce is 0.0057. The confidence for this rule is 0.3006 which means that out of all the transactions containing mushroom, 30.06% of the transactions are likely to contain escalope as well. Finally, lift of 3.79 shows that the escalope is 3.79 more likely to be bought by the customers that buy mushroom cream sauce, compared to its default sale.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Association rule mining algorithms such as Apriori are very useful for finding simple associations between our data items. They are easy to implement and have high explain-ability. However for more advanced insights, such those used by Google or Amazon etc., more complex algorithms, such as recommender systems, are used. However, you can probably see that this method is a very simple way to get basic associations if that's all your use-case needs."
