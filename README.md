# Apriori-Algorithm
Association rule mining algorithms such as Apriori are very useful for finding simple associations between our data items. They are easy to implement and have high explain-ability. However for more advanced insights, such those used by Google or Amazon etc., more complex algorithms, such as recommender systems, are used. However, you can probably see that this method is a very simple way to get basic associations if that's all your use-case needs.
